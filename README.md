# js-daily

This is a place for me to practice topics of study. It serves as a sandbox for me to learn and try new things all while pushing code in one place to reference if needed.

# Philosophy

This repo was created with the USE, UNDERSTAND and BUILD philosophy

# Use

Get some practice writing out some new syntax. In this stage you don't have to fully understand what is going on. Just take some time to write out a new concept/syntax and just USE it.

# Understand

Break the code down and undertand why it works. 

# Build

Build something new using what you learned
